# Security

MITRE recently introduced its ATLAS framework, which follows a TTP (tactics, techniques, and procedures) approach but centred on AI development security: <https://atlas.mitre.org/> It provides a good starting point for identifying and investigating possible threats.

**Steps:**

1. Identify adversaries
2. Identify attack vectors
3. Identify production-time attack points
4. Identify development-time attack points
5. Conduct a TTP analysis considering these attack points


See an example [use of MITRE ATLAS for a biometric ML model](./mitre-atlas-example.pdf). More detail: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10409480>
